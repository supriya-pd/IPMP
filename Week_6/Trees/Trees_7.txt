Populate Inorder Successor for all nodes  - gfg

-- idea is to use reverse inorder traversal, so u will get to visit successor first, just keep track
 also, don't use static variable because then in different test cases also it won't get reinitialized


void pt(struct node *p,struct node **next)
{
     if(p)
 {
     pt(p->right,next);
     
     p->next = *next;
     *next = p;
     
     pt(p->left,next);
 }
}
void populateNext(struct node* p)
{
    struct node *next=NULL;
pt(p,&next);
 
}
